# Tata iQ GenAI-Powered Credit Risk Strategy – Forage Project

🎓 I completed Tata iQ’s **GenAI-Powered Data Analytics Simulation** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/), where I used AI-assisted techniques to help Geldium Finance reduce credit card delinquency.

- 📊 Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover risk patterns and data quality issues
- 🧠 Designed a **predictive model framework** using Logistic Regression, prioritizing interpretability and fairness
- 📝 Delivered a **business-ready report** with SMART recommendations for Collections
- 📈 Created an **executive presentation deck** outlining system design, AI ethics, and expected impact
- ✅ Integrated responsible AI practices including fairness audits and explainability
